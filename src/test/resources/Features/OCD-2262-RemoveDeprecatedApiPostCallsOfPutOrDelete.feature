Feature: OCD-2262 - Remove API POST calls that were deprecated in favor of PUT/DELETE 
    This test checks whether deprecated calls are removed from CHPL API webpage

Scenario: CHPL API page loads and shows correct title 
    Given I am on CHPL API page 
    Then the page title should be "CHPL API" 
 
Scenario Outline: 
    Verify API list in Controller does not contain deprecated calls 
    Given I am on CHPL API page 
    When I click on "<Controller>" link 
    Then list of "<API Endpoints>" operations should be displayed without deprecated calls
